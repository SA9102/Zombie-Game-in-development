# Zombie-Game-in-development

A top-down, zombie shooter game which is currently in development by myself. This game is being made with Python using the Pygame library.

Right now this program is very early in development and cannot be considered a game at this stage.

Current features:
  - Move with WASD keys, aim and shoot with mouse. Only pistol available.
  - Crosshairs that follow the mouse
  - Zombies spawn every three seconds and follow player. Zombies can be killed. Zombies currently do not hurt the player.
  - Head-up display including weapon, weapon ammo and health bar
